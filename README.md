## **Overview**

LensBall is a fast-paced, addicting game developed using SpriteKit. The core concept revolves around a dynamic lens through which users can see balls moving behind it. The goal is simple yet challenging: hit a target number of balls before the timer runs out. The game is designed to test both speed and accuracy, keeping players engaged and coming back for more.

## Gameplay

Objective: Hit the target number of balls before time runs out.

## Mechanics:

The user can only see balls through the lens, making it a unique visual challenge.

Balls move in the background, and users must quickly react to hit them.

The lens exterior changes colors to add visual feedback and enhance the game's intensity.

Scoring: Players' scores increase with each successful hit. The faster you hit the target, the higher your score.

## Features

Dynamic Lens: The central feature allowing users to only view objects through its scope.

Colorful Balls: Implemented various colored balls for visual variety.

Changing Lens Color: The lens border changes colors to indicate game states or add visual appeal.

Scoring System: Real-time score updates to keep users motivated.

Timer: A countdown timer adds pressure and excitement.

## Team

Our development team consisted of four members:

2 Designers: Responsible for creating the gameâ€™s visual assets and overall design aesthetic.

2 Coders: Implemented game mechanics, interactions, and scoring logic.
